This directory contains the following files:

hello.c                     # The C file that will import and run the
                            # Hello function
hello.so -> ../_Go/hello.so # The shared object generated by go build
hello.h  -> ../_Go/hello.h  # The C header file generated by go build

The symbolic links are the files that were generated by executing 
`go build -buildmode=c-shared -o hello.so .` in the _Go directory.

In order to execute the Hello function from the shared object simply
compile and run the hello.c file.

```
$ gcc hello.c hello.so
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd) ./a.out 
Hello! I can print text with an underline.
```
