This directory contains the following files:

hello.c                   # The C file that will import and run the
                          # Hello function
hello   -> ../_Go/hello   # The shared object generated by go build
hello.h -> ../_Go/hello.h # The C header file generated by go build

The symbolic links are the files that were generated by executing 
`go build -buildmode=c-shared -o hello .` in the _Go directory.

In order to execute the Hello function from the shared object simply
compile and run the hello.c file.

$ gcc hello.c hello
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd) ./a.out 
Hello! I can print cyan text with an underline.
